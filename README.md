#  Arabic Digit Recognizer

A deep learning-based system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten Arabic digits (0‚Äì9). Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the model achieves over 96% accuracy on the test dataset. This project is ideal for OCR tasks, educational tools, or integrating into applications that require Arabic numeral digitization.
